		<h1>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</h1>
		<p class="zelenapozadina">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Born in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized.</p>

		<h2>Zanimljivosti</h2>
		<p>Nakon samo jednog slušanja zborske skladbe „Miserere“ Gregoria Allegrija, koja je uglavnom bila četveroglasna i peteroglasna (pri kraju i deveteroglasna), uspio ju je, po sjećanju, cijelu zapisati gotovo bez ijedne pogreške. Papa ga je tada odlikovao ordenom „zlatne mamuze“ sa titulom cavaliera, koju je prije njega dobio samo mali broj glazbenika.</p>
